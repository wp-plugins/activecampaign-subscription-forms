== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I create ActiveCampaign subscription forms to use in WordPress? =

You need to be running ActiveCampaign's [email marketing software](http://www.activecampaign.com/) to use this widget. Create new subscriptions forms in the software by going to the "Integration" section, then they will appear in this widget.

= I get a "Connection failed" message. What does this mean? =

Please make sure that your login information is correct, and that you are using a version of ActiveCampaign that supports API actions for subscription forms (You need version 5.0.16 or above).

= What does "Fetch form with each page load" mean? =

If you check this box, WordPress will re-request the details of your form each time the page is loaded. For performance reasons, it's best to leave this box unchecked.
